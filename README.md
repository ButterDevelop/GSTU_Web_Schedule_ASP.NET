# GSTU Web Schedule ASP.NET 2021 (begin of 2022)
*GSTU_Web_Schedule_ASP.NET*

## Maxim Lyutikov
Project for my university: [**Sukhoi State Technical University of Gomel (GSTU)**](https://en.gstu.by)

This service was created to help teachers and simplify their paperwork.

### Used technologies: `ASP.NET`, `MVC`, `Razor Pages`, `Bootstrap`, `MSSQL`, `JavaScript`, `Key stretching`, `Hashing with salt`.

The service has its own **Translation System**. It is translated into two languages - **Russian** and **English**. That means, you can view screenshots I placed here in two languages.

The service has its own **Email notification system** and **Email confirmation system**.

The service has a **System of ranks** - **user** and **administrator** privileges are initially implemented.

The service has a **System of logs** - you can see what actions were taken from your account (for example, if you think that you have been hacked).

The service has many **Easter eggs**. From the most obvious to the very hidden.

The service contains security measures for users: `PBKDF2`, `hashing passwords with salt (HMACSHA256)`, `strong cryptographic generator`, `key stretching (100.000 iterations)`.
